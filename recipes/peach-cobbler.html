        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>A healthy and tasty recipe for peach cobbler.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><u>For the filling</u></strong></li>
                <li>3.5 cups peaches--slightly overripe</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/6 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 tsp almond extract</li>
                <li><strong><u>For the topping</u></strong></li>
                <li>3/4 cup white whole wheat or gluten free flour</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter, cold and cubed</li>
                <li>1/4 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt</li>
                <li>1/4 cup pure maple syrup</li>
                <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                <li><strong>Pan</strong>: recommend 8-inch square pan, 9-inch round cake pan, or 9-inch round pie plate
                for best results</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350 F, coat 8-inch square or 9-inch round pan with nonstick cooking spray</li>
                <li><strong>Prep the filling</strong>: Optional to peel peaches or not. Very thinly slice, about 1/8inch slices. 
                            Toss with the filling ingredients, until cinnamon evenly coats them and Cornstarch
                            has dissolved with zero visible white specks.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the topping</strong>: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in small bowl.
                            Cut butter until mixture resembles fine crumbs. Make a well in the center. Pour in Greek yogurt, syrup, and
                            vanilla extract. Stir until batter just comes together.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble--and quickly!</strong>: Baking soda will change texture so work fast. Put filling
                            in pan, press down with spatula to make even surface. Dollop batter on top, spread it across
                            fruit, use delicate touch.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake</strong>: It's finished when the topping looks light gold and is firm to the touch. 
                            You should see the peach juice bubbling around the edges of the pan too.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool and chill</strong>: Preferably at room temp for 3+ hours, but can speed up by putting
                            in the fridge. You want the filling to be solid enough to not totally fall apart when you cut
                            into it.</li>
            </ol>
