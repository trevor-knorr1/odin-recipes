        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><u>For the filling</u></strong></li>
                <li>3.5 cups peaches--slightly overripe</li>
                <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/6 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
                <li>2 tsp cornstarch</li>
                <li>1 tsp almond extract</li>
                <li><strong><u>For the topping</u></stong></li>
                <li>3/4 cup white whole wheat or gluten free flour</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
                <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
                <li>1/8 tsp salt</li>
                <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter, cold and cubed</li>
                <li>1/4 cup plain nonfat Greek yogurt</li>
                <li>1/4 cup pure maple syrup</li>
                <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prep the peaches</strong>: Optional to peel them or not. Very thinly slice. 
                            Toss with the filling ingredients, until cinnamon evenly coats them and Cornstarch
                            has dissolved.</li>
                <li><strong>Make the topping</strong>: Do in separate bowl. Cut butter until it resembles fine crumbs. 
                            Pour in the remaining ingredients and stir until batter comes together.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble--and quickly!</strong>: Baking soda will change texture so work fast. Put filling
                            in pan,press down with spatula to make even surface. Dollop batter on top, spread it across
                            fruit, use delicate touch.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake</strong>: It's finished when the topping looks light gold and is firm to the touch. 
                            You should see the peach juice bubbling away around the edges of the pan too.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool and chill</strong>: Preferably at room temp for 3+ hours, but can speed up by putting
                            in the fridge. You want the filling to be solid enough to not totally fall apart when you cut
                            into it.</li>
            </ol>
